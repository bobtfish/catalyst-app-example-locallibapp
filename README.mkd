So... this is an implementation of Catalyst's scripts that use local::lib

Unfortunately, stock local::lib doesn't seem to work right! So I had to make some small patches.

    1. Favor $PERL5LIB over priv/archexplib
    2. Untaint @INC, so perl programs that do taint checking (-T) don't compain
    3. Only re-export the $PER5LIB we started with, so @INC doesn't grow and grow and grow (use ./recursive-print to see this)

The patch is in local-lib trunk, at: 

http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/bast/local-lib/1.000/trunk/

Procedure:

    git clone git://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-example-locallibapp.git
    cd catalyst-app-example-locallibapp
    
    # To bootstrap local::lib, runs your Makefile.PL, runs make installdeps
    ./script/bootstrap.sh
    # And go!
    ./script/catalyst-server.pl

Additional scripts available:

bootstrap.sh            installdeps.sh          locallibapp_server.pl
cpan-install.pl         locallibapp_cgi.pl      locallibapp_test.pl
cpan-shell.sh           locallibapp_create.pl   shell.sh
env                     locallibapp_fastcgi.pl

  env - The core script, does all the magic.
  bootstrap.sh - create initial local-lib5 directory

  shell.sh - a bash shell with this app's local::lib setup _NOT SELF CONTAINED_
  perl.pl - run perl with this app's local::lib setup

  cpan-install.pl - Install a specific module from CPAN
  cpan-shell.sh - perl -MCPAN -eshell

Note about self contained mode:

  We try to do everything in local::libs --self-contained mode
  so that everything which is a non-core dependency is bundled for you,
  and you will only see the core module and the contents of your local::lib

  However, only perl scripts directly under our control can be forced into
  this mode.

  The correct way to install dependencies in a local::lib based application
  is to add them to your Makefile.PL, then make installdeps - this will
  ensure that any non-core dependencies needed are installed with their
  dependencies in a correctly self contained manor.

  If you install dependencies using shell.sh, then you can get into trouble
  if your local system perl already has some of the dependencies, then these
  will not be bundled with your application as expected.

Disabling local::lib mode:

  You can totally disable local::lib mode just by deleting the generated
  local-lib5 directory.

  It is possible do totally disable local::lib on a temporary basis by setting
  the CATALYST_LOCAL_LIB environment variable to 0
