So... this is an implementation of Catalyst's scripts that use local::lib

Unfortunately, stock local::lib doesn't seem to work right! So I had to make some small patches.

    1. Favor $PERL5LIB over priv/archexplib
    2. Untaint @INC, so perl programs that do taint checking (-T) don't compain
    3. Only re-export the $PER5LIB we started with, so @INC doesn't grow and grow and grow (use ./recursive-print to see this)

The patch is in local-lib.diff (script/local-lib.diff)

All in all, it works pretty well, and most of CPAN is well behaved

* Test::Simple (t/exit.t) is a problem, because it uses a custom perl invocation (that munges with @INC), won't install
* ExtUtils::MakeMaker fails a ton of tests (but this is just ignored?), won't install
* Mouse has a failing test, won't install

Procedure:

    # To bootstrap local::lib
    cd patched-local-lib
    /path/to/locallibapp/script/cpan -i .

    # To install Catalyst
    cd locallibapp
    ./script/cpan -i -f Test::Simple
    ./script/cpan -i -f Mouse
    ./script/cpan -i Module::Install
    ./script/make-installdeps
    ./script/catalyst-server
