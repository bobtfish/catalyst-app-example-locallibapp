So... this is an implementation of Catalyst's scripts that use local::lib

Unfortunately, stock local::lib doesn't seem to work right! So I had to make some small patches.

    1. Favor $PERL5LIB over priv/archexplib
    2. Untaint @INC, so perl programs that do taint checking (-T) don't compain
    3. Only re-export the $PER5LIB we started with, so @INC doesn't grow and grow and grow (use ./recursive-print to see this)

The patch is in local-lib trunk, at: 

http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/bast/local-lib/1.000/trunk/

Procedure:

    git clone git://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-example-locallibapp.git
    cd catalyst-app-example-locallibapp
    
    # To bootstrap local::lib
    ./script/bootstrap.sh
    # And go!
    ./script/catalyst-server

Scripts available:

env - the core script, does all the magic.
bootstrap.sh - create initial local_lib5 directory and enable local::lib mode

shell.sh - a bash shell with this app's local::lib setup
perl.pl - run perl with this app's local::lib setup

cpan-install.pl
cpanp - FIXME
cpan-shell - perl -MCPAN -eshell

catalyst-fastcgi - standard catalyst generated scripts, but changed to use
                   local::lib
catalyst-server
catalyst-test
catalyst-cgi
catalyst-create

How to make a self-contained script:

< use FindBin;
< use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";

> use FindBin;
> BEGIN { do "$FindBin::Bin/env" or die $@ }

Maybe env should be called "local-lib-env" or "lib-env"?
