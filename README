So... this is an implementation of Catalyst's scripts that use local::lib

Unfortunately, stock local::lib doesn't seem to work right! So I had to make some small patches.

    1. Favor $PERL5LIB over priv/archexplib
    2. Untaint @INC, so perl programs that do taint checking (-T) don't compain
    3. Only re-export the $PER5LIB we started with, so @INC doesn't grow and grow and grow (use ./recursive-print to see this)

The patch is in local-lib trunk, at: 

http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/bast/local-lib/1.000/trunk/

Procedure:

    git clone git://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-example-locallibapp.git
    cd catalyst-app-example-locallibapp
    
    # To bootstrap local::lib
    ./script/bootstrap.sh
    # And go!
    ./script/catalyst-server

Additional scripts available:

  env - the core script, does all the magic.
  bootstrap.sh - create initial local_lib5 directory and enable local::lib mode

  shell.sh - a bash shell with this app's local::lib setup
  perl.pl - run perl with this app's local::lib setup

  cpan-install.pl
  cpanp - FIXME
  cpan-shell - perl -MCPAN -eshell

Note about self contained mode:

  We try to do everything in local::libs --self-contained mode
  so that everything which is a non-core dependency is bundled for you,
  and you will only see the core module and the contents of your local::lib

  However, only perl scripts directly under our controll can be forced into
  this mode.

  The correct way to install dependencies in a local::lib based application
  is to add them to your Makefile.PL, then make installdeps - this will
  ensure that any non-core dependencies needed
